Subject: [PATCH] plat: rpi5: add basic Raspberry Pi 5 support

RPi5 is based on new BCM2712 SoC which is based on quad Cortex-A76.

BCM2712 still does not provide secure memory so we are free to locate
OP-TEE anything we want. It would be most beneficial to locate OP-TEE
right after TF-A, at address 0x80000, but RPi5 loader places kernel
there and it's location can't be changed.

According to PCB silkscreen, RPi5 boards can have 1GB, 2GB, 4GB or 8GB
of memory. To be compatible with any variant, OP-TEE is placed close
to the end of the first gigabyte.

BCM2712 uses PL011 as debug UART so we enable its driver.

According to specification, BCM2712 includes cryptography extensions,
but this basic port does not enable them.
